# splashkit-2d-platformer
A barebones 2d platformer using the C# splashkit library 

## The idea
What I plan to do with SplashKit and C# is to make the bearbones of a platformer game. It will contain a floor and the player along with a basic movement script to allow the user to move the player. This is the basis that all 2D platformers are built upon and is a good place to understand interactivity within a program.

**In Scope:**
- Floor collision
- Jumping
- Walk left
- Walk right
- Gravity
**Not In Scope:**
- Sprint Left
- Sprint Right
- Extra Platforms

A showcase of this task can be found [here](https://youtu.be/VCrdEcClQWc) since most of the features implemented can not be contained within a screen shot.
